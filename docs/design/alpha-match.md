# Alpha match: two VR players, one table, video and voice in the headset

**Status:** design 2026-10-30; built 2026-10-31 on `main` (A6 + C3, D2, D7, H4: `match/controller.ts`, `main/match-host.ts`, `media/rtc-host.ts`, `media/panel-page.ts`, `media/vr-overlay.ts`, `vr-overlay/`), untested on a rig; the §6 checks are the gate. Design for the first real match (owner + tester Krobs, both in VR). Builds on the Phase 1 engine
(`companion/src/match/`), A2/A3 (WebSocket transfer and reconnect), the live detector (C2), the turn lock in hook
0.1.0+ (`vpx-hook/castcade.vbs`, Phase 0c pass), the VR detection (`witness/vr-detect.ts`) and the D1 media stack.
Owner ask 2026-10-30: build the final product, not an interim; video and voice between the players; both in VR.
Rulings that bind this: peer-hosted (no media on ArcAid), ADR 0002 (a match is a Throwdown; the ArcAid lobby comes
later, F6), ADR 0007 (functionality first, guided setup).

## 1. What a player does

1. Both players open the same table in VPX (same file; the fingerprint says if not) with the Castcade patch, in VR
   with `VRPreview` on and its window 1280x720 (`[PlayerVR] PreviewWidth / PreviewHeight`).
2. The host opens Castcade → **Match** → *Host*: Castcade listens on a TCP port (setting, default 27401), shows the
   invite string `castcade:ws://<public ip>:<port>#<code>` and the sentence "forward TCP 27401 to this PC on your
   router"; the host copies the invite to the other player (Discord, text). The client pastes it under *Join*.
3. When everyone is in, the host presses *Start match*. From then on the engine rotates turns: ball 1 of each player
   in join order, then ball 2, and so on (3 balls; the host picks 3 or 5).
4. The companion **locks the table** (writes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Castcade\lock\turn.lock`) whenever it is not this
   player's turn; the hook swallows flipper, plunger, start and nudge keys while the file exists. A grant for this
   player deletes the file, plays a short **sound cue** ("your ball"; the headset is the default audio device) and the
   in-headset panel says `YOUR BALL 2`. The *Start* key is a play key too, so each player starts their own one-player
   game when their first grant arrives, not before.
5. While it is my turn my VR preview window streams to the others (video goes only from the player up; voice is an
   open mesh with a mute key). The others see it on the **panel**: on the desktop a Castcade window; in VR the same
   panel drawn in the headset by the OpenVR overlay helper (§5), anchored to the head, bottom edge.
6. The detector's `ball_end` becomes `BALL_END` (final score sampled after the end-of-ball bonus: the first
   `current_scores` after the ball end, or 2 s), `game_end` becomes `GAME_OVER`; after everyone's last ball the host
   issues `RESULT`, every companion signs, both panels show the standings. Each player's game ALSO posts to ArcAid as
   a normal Witness score, so the boards see both games today; the Throwdown result on arcaid.app is A5 / F6.

## 2. Pieces and owners (one worktree agent each)

| Piece | Files | Item |
|---|---|---|
| **Match in the app**: `MatchController` (pure: grants → lock/unlock + cue, detector events → BALL_END / GAME_OVER / STATE, result), `main/match-host.ts` (keys, `WsPeerTransport`, invite, IPC), the **Match** tab, the audio cue, the `event` emitter on the witness | `companion/src/match/controller.ts`, `main/match-host.ts`, `main/index.ts` (wiring), `main/ipc-types.ts`, `preload/index.cts`, `renderer/src/views/Match.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `castcade.d.ts`, `witness/witness.ts` + `types.ts` (the `event` emitter only), `main/witness-host.ts` (`onEvent`) | A6 + C3 |
| **Media**: `MEDIA_SIGNAL` in the protocol, relay in host/client, the panel page (RTC peer connections + the panel UI in one hidden-or-visible BrowserWindow), `rtc-host.ts` implementing `MatchMedia` | `protocol/**`, `companion/src/match/host.ts` + `client.ts` (relay only), `companion/src/media/rtc-signaling.ts`, `panel-page.ts`, `rtc-host.ts`, `media-settings.ts` | D2 |
| **VR overlay helper**: `vr-overlay/` (C++17, CMake, OpenVR SDK pinned), a CI build, `media/vr-overlay.ts` (spawn + frame pipe) implementing `VrOverlay` | `vr-overlay/**`, `.github/workflows/vr-overlay.yml`, `companion/scripts/fetch-vr-overlay.mjs`, `companion/electron-builder.yml` (one extraResources entry), `companion/src/media/vr-overlay.ts` | D7 |
| **Runbook** for the two players | `docs/alpha-match-runbook.md` | H4 |

The contract between the three code pieces is `companion/src/media/match-media-types.ts` (written with this doc):
`MatchMedia` (what the controller drives), `PanelState` (what the panel shows), `PanelFrameSource` and `VrOverlay`
(how the panel's frames reach the headset). Agents code against it; nobody changes it without telling the lead.

## 3. Match controller (A6 + C3)

- Role objects come from the engine: `HostMatch` or `ClientMatch` on a `Session` over `WsPeerTransport`.
- **Keys**: one Ed25519 pair per companion, `<userData>/match-keys.json` (`match/keys.ts` export/import).
- **Participant**: `playerId` = a stable per-install id (the pairing device id when paired, else a UUID stored with the
  keys); `displayName` = the pairing username (`WitnessSettings.username`), editable on the Match tab; `rig` =
  `vr_headset` when the witness's VR observation says `inVr`, else `pc`. Built (A6 fix, 2026-10-31): decided at host /
  join by probing the running VPX process now (the witness's attestation could hold a sample from before the player
  started; the owner's first match got the desktop panel in VR that way), else the witness's last sample; the witness
  also re-samples at `table_loaded`, and a match decided `pc` switches to the headset (panel re-attached offscreen,
  overlay started) when that reads VR. The Match tab shows the decision and its evidence (`MatchStatus.rig`, `rigReason`).
- **GameFingerprint** from the witness's current identity: `tableName`, `tableHash` = `TableIdentity.sha256` (zeros
  when unknown), `romName`, `romHash: null`, `physicsHash: null`, `recipeVersion` = the loaded recipe version. A
  client whose fingerprint differs from the host's is shown "different table file" on both panels (advisory).
- **Lock**: `lock()` creates `turn.lock` (empty file, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Castcade\lock\`), `unlock()` deletes it. Locked
  the moment the match starts; unlocked by a verified grant for me; locked again when my `ball_end` is accepted (the
  next grant is someone else's) and at match end (then unlocked when the match closes, so solo play works again).
- **Detector → engine**: witness emits every `GameEvent` (`event`); the controller, while holding a grant:
  `current_scores` → `reportState` (≤ 10 Hz, score = player 1's); `ball_end` → wait for the next `current_scores` or
  2 s → `reportBallEnd(grantSeq, ballNumber, finalScore, 'nvram', shootAgain = (extraBalls ?? 0) > 0)`;
  `game_end` → `reportGameOver(score, balls)`; `game_abandoned` / `table_exit` → `forfeit('table closed')`.
- **Cue**: a hidden BrowserWindow with WebAudio (no asset): two rising tones for "your ball", one low tone for
  "opponent up", a chord for "match over"; volume setting; the panel text changes at the same moment.
- **Match tab**: Host (port, balls per game, invite string + copy, "forward TCP <port>"), Join (paste), roster with
  rig and table-file agreement, the big turn line, scores per player, result, Leave. The invite's public IP comes from
  `https://api.ipify.org` (one GET, failure → the LAN address with a note to replace it).
- **Media hooks**: on `MATCH_READY` → `media.attach(signalling, peerIds)`; on my grant → `media.setSending(true)`; on
  my `ball_end` accepted → `setSending(false)`; every state change → `media.setPanelState(...)`; on leave → `detach()`.
  In VR (`inVr`) the controller also starts `VrOverlay` with the panel's frame source; on the desktop the panel window
  is simply shown. The VR runtime (`RigDecision.runtime`, B22) picks the overlay (D7.3, 2026-10-31): SteamVR → the
  OpenVR overlay helper (§5); any OpenXR runtime (the owner's rig: Virtual Desktop's, through OpenComposite) → the
  Castcade OpenXR layer (§5). A later reading on a runtime that needs the other one swaps them. The rig, `play_device`
  and the capture pick follow `inVr`.

## 4. Media (D2)

- **Signalling**: new protocol message `MEDIA_SIGNAL` `{ to: PlayerId, kind: 'offer' | 'answer' | 'ice', sdp?: string,
  candidate?: { candidate: string; sdpMid: string | null; sdpMLineIndex: number | null } }`, direction `any`; the host
  relays it to `to` only (never logged, like STATE); protocol stays 2 (unreleased). Built: `HELLO_ACK.hostGame` was added too, so a client learns of a table-file mismatch and both panels flag it (the host accepts the HELLO in `advise` mode). Prose: a "Media signalling"
  section (what is signalled, that media never crosses ArcAid, that video flows only from the player up).
- **Topology**: full mesh of `RTCPeerConnection`s (2–4 players; perfect negotiation, polite = the lexically smaller
  playerId). Voice: every peer sends its microphone, Opus, echo cancellation and noise suppression on, open mic with a
  mute toggle (push-to-talk is a later setting; a VR player's hands hold the flippers). Video: ONE track per peer,
  enabled only while that peer is the player up (`setSending`), 1280x720 at 30 fps, `maxBitrate` 2.5 Mbps; receivers
  show the up player's track. This bounds upload to one video stream per rig and survives a host transfer without
  renegotiation (the handoff's host-forwarding is not needed at 2–4 players; revisit at the SFU step).
- **Capture**: `desktopCapturer` window source: in VR the VPX VR preview window (title from `probeWindows()`: the
  window of the VPX process that is not "Visual Pinball Player"; the agent confirms the title on the fixtures /
  comments and falls back to the largest VPX window), else the player window. Microphone from a named device
  (`micDeviceId` setting; the panel lists devices, and before a match a hidden page in the same partition does when
  the Match tab opens, B22; the Windows default is often a virtual device in VR).
- **ICE**: STUN `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302` and `stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302`; optional TURN from settings
  (`turnUrl`, `turnUser`, `turnCredential`); no relay of ours yet.
- **Panel page**: one HTML page (a template string, like `stream-host.ts`'s audio page) holding the peer connections
  AND the UI: the up player's video large, a header `YOUR BALL 2` / `<name> IS UP`, a score strip (name, score, ball),
  the mic state, a one-line message (errors, "different table file"). Dark, high-contrast, legible at 0.6 m in a
  headset. In VR the window is created `show: false` with `webPreferences.offscreen: true` and its `paint` events
  (`setFrameRate(20)`) feed `PanelFrameSource`; on the desktop it is a normal always-on-top window.

## 5. VR overlay helper (D7)

- `vr-overlay/` C++17, CMake, MSVC; OpenVR SDK pinned by tag + sha256 (`openvr.h`, `openvr_api.dll`, `.lib`; BSD-3,
  attributed in `vr-overlay/THIRD-PARTY.md`). `castcade-vr-overlay.exe --width-m 0.55 --anchor hmd --offset 0,-0.28,-0.9
  [--alpha 0.95] [--key castcade.panel]`.
- stdin frame protocol: 16-byte little-endian header `magic "CVO1" · u32 width · u32 height · u32 byteLength` then
  `byteLength` bytes of BGRA; each frame replaces the last (`IVROverlay::SetOverlayRaw`). The helper shows the overlay
  on the first frame, hides it after 5 s without frames, exits 0 on stdin EOF, exit 2 when SteamVR is not running,
  3 on an OpenVR error, and prints one JSON line per event on stdout (`{"event":"ready"}`, `{"event":"hidden"}`, …).
- `companion/src/media/vr-overlay.ts`: `createVrOverlay(opts)` spawns it (path from `resources/vr-overlay/`,
  dev fallback `vr-overlay/build/Release/`), pipes `PanelFrameSource` frames (drop frames when the pipe is behind),
  restarts once if it exits unexpectedly, reports `unavailable` with the reason on exit 2/3. The match host starts it
  only on SteamVR (B22, 2026-10-31): the helper draws into SteamVR's compositor, which an OpenXR runtime such as
  Virtual Desktop's does not run.
- CI: `.github/workflows/vr-overlay.yml` builds on `windows-latest` on every push touching `vr-overlay/**`, uploads
  the exe as an artifact, attaches it to the GitHub release on `v*` tags; `companion/scripts/fetch-vr-overlay.mjs`
  downloads it from a pinned release tag into `companion/resources/vr-overlay/` (or `--from <dir>` for a local build);
  `electron-builder.yml` ships that folder as `vr-overlay`.
- **OpenXR runtimes (D7.3, 2026-10-31):** `vr-layer/` is an implicit OpenXR API layer (`XrApiLayer_castcade_panel.dll`
  + manifest, OpenXR headers pinned by tag + sha256) that loads inside `VPinballX*.exe` on any runtime and appends the
  panel as one head-locked `XrCompositionLayerQuad` (same placement as the helper). Frames come over the named pipe
  `\\.\pipe\castcade-panel` in the helper's stdin format. `companion/src/media/vr-layer.ts` registers the manifest
  under `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\1\ApiLayers\Implicit` and feeds the pipe (`panel-frame-writer.ts`, shared with
  the helper). The loader reads the list when VPX starts VR, so a VPX started before the first registration needs a
  restart (`restart_vpx` on the Match tab). CI `vr-layer.yml`; `fetch-vr-layer.mjs`; shipped as `vr-layer`.

## 6. Checks only the rig can answer (run before the first match)

1. **VR controller input under the lock** (15 min): with a table open in VR, create `turn.lock` by hand; the flippers
   must go dead; delete it; they return. If VR controller buttons bypass `_KeyDown`, the lock needs the plugin path.
2. A table left with a ball in the shooter lane for several minutes: ball save, attract timers, auto-plunge.
3. The VR preview window capture inside the companion (the spike proved it at 1280x720).
4. The overlay helper drawing over VPX's VR session; readability of the panel at the chosen size and offset.
5. Krobs' and the owner's routers: direct WebRTC with STUN; the host's forwarded TCP port for the match socket.

## 7. Not in this milestone

The ArcAid lobby and Throwdown result (F6, A5), host transfer in the UI (engine only), the runner stage and watch link
(D3, D4, D5), push-to-talk, a TURN server of ours, DMD frames on the panel.
